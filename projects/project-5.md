summary: A web application made for ICS students at UH Manoa, specifically members of the Programming and Algorithms (PANDA) SIG of ACM Manoa, to assist them in solving problems and storing solutions.

## Overview

I learned several concepts and aspects of software engineering in my ICS 314: Software Engineering I class. A month before the end of the semester, students were assigned to complete a working web application in groups of 3-5 people that will serve the UH community in some way. My group was selected to create a web application that will allow UHM students, specifically the ones in computer science, who either want to improve their skills in algorithms or are preparing for technical interviews. An alternate to websites such as LeetCode, UH Code Submissions serves mainly for members of PANDA (Programming and Algorithms) SIG of ACM Manoa as an efficient, comprehensive location to submit and store problems and solutions.

#### This application includes:
- New Problem Page (admin): a page where only admins can add new problems.
- Problems Page (admin): a page with published problems by the admin. The admin is able to edit problems on the problems page. Each problem includes a brief overview of the problem and a tag for its category.
- Problems Page (user): a page with published problems by the admin. A user is able to submit a solution to a selected problem. Similar to the admin's side, each problem includes a brief overview of the problem and a tag for its category.
- Solutions Page (user): the user is directed here after selecting to submit a solution to a problem.
- Profile Page (admin and user): admins and users have their own profile page where they are able to write (and edit) a short bio about themselves.

## Development Process

I contributed to the project through various means in front-end design and back-end development. I helped with the overall UI design and look of the pages, and came up with the idea of having a dark, simple theme for the entire application. I helped contribute to the navigation bar, landing page, add/edit problems portion for admins, creating the problems page, and adding a portion of submitted problems and new problems added to the user and admin pages on the profile pages respectively. I also led the process for creating, updating, and maintaining our project homepage.

I started the process by working on the landing page, and creating the navigation bar options for the users and admins. Since the admin had an additional tab contributing to adding a new problem, I had to create a separate admin-protected tab solely for the admins. After completing the navigation bar (which actually underwent several changes over the course of three milestones), I created the original default landing page with three features of the website and the signin and signup options. I implemneted a few additional parts to the signup page, such as Name, Image, and Bio.

## Accomplishments

Originally, I had not realized how crucial databases and a proper understanding of them were necessary for web development, but it was a new concept I picked up during the class.
