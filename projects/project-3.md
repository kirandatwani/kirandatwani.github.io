Right now, I am working on getting the two papers published in different journals. With the help from my advisor, I hope to publish my COVID-19 reflection paper where international students who desire to study abroad can have a look at how the pandemic affected my studies and overall lifestyle in a foreign country. As for my Ikigai and Technology paper, after a few more trials of editing, there might be a shot at publishing it in the Honors journal at UH Manoa.
