## How It Started

A little more than a year ago, I was conflicted in majoring in computer science. It seemed like all the wishes and dreams I had had for the last three to four years were impossible to accomplish, and the experience of programming and problem-solving that once brought me a sense of comfort and satisfaction were slowly losing their magic touch. What I would spend hours on in the past trying to understand suddenly became too painful and frustrating. What once brought me joy seemed too difficult to continue. I was trying to remember what made me fall in love with technology and programming in the first place.

Due to my inner conflict, and a bit of sponetousity, I decided to leave Hawaii behind and study abroad in Japan to rekindle the love I once had for technology. During my time as a study abroad student, I took on a research project connecting the information age and technology with a common term in Japan known as "ikigai". A simple word that means a purpose in your life, your reason for being. With little guidance and mentorship, I embarked on a new journey, but it wasn't easy. I didn't realize what exactly "ikigai" meant to people, much less myself; most of the information was in journals dating several years ago, but for the most part, I hadn't realized how many people in Japan were in the same situation as me. People in schools, colleges, and workplaces all felt that they had to contribute a part of themselves for the betterment for the whole of the community, whether that be in their family or workplace. Better late than never, I realized that the people who were living with "ikigai" weren't trying to, but they would accept their situation and find peace knowing that what is meant to happen will happen.

## How It's Going

This new mindset helped me start seeing myself and my goals in a new light. I was able to tie into my search for ikigai with the passion I had for computer science, programming, and technology. I took note how several people were able to turn their passion into products, and I was able to observe in events and sites such as <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab</a> and <a href="https://kc-i.jp/tw/">Knowledge Capital</a>.

While this paper reflected less on my personal thoughts, I was able to convey the message I had learned and observed while studying abroad. Alongside this paper, because I was studying abroad precisely at the time the pandemic began to grow, I worked on a more reflective piece about my experiences studying abroad during a pandemic as an international student.

Right now, I am working on getting the two papers published in different journals. With the help from my advisor, I hope to publish my COVID-19 reflection paper where international students who desire to study abroad can have a look at how the pandemic affected my studies and overall lifestyle in a foreign country. As for my Ikigai and Technology paper, after a few more trials of editing, there might be a shot at publishing it in the Honors journal at UH Manoa.
