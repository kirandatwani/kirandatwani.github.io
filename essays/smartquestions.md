What exactly does it mean to ask "smart" questions? To one person, it could be a question that has a thought-provoking, open-ended answer, and to another, it might be a question that many other people were curious about, but weren't sure how to ask. Since we are young, we are told to always ask questions: to your teacher, professors, potential employers, and the list goes on. At a young age, we are told that there are no "stupid" questions, but in any field, there is a right way and a wrong way to ask a question. Smart questions are questions that are precise, intriguing and to-the-point. Most importantly, the audience, such as an experienced programmer or hacker, should not feel like they wasted their valuable time answering a question a person didn't put effort in asking. The person asking questions without much thought isn't well-respected or regarded by any community, and usually left unanswered or with sarcasm. As written by Eric Steven Raymond, *"it's simply not efficient for us to try to help people who are not willing to help themselves. It's OK to be ignorant; it's not OK to play stupid"*.

## Asking a Question: The Wrong Way

Next, you will search for a question submitted by a different developer that demonstrates the “not smart way”. In other words, this question violates the principles established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question in a “not smart” way does not lead to both effective and efficient help


## Final Thoughts

The goal of this exercise is not to “prove” that asking questions the smart way is always better. Instead, the goal of this exercise is to help you form a deeper understanding of what constitutes “smart” and “not smart” questions so that you are more likely to ask smart ones in the future.

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.
