Personally, ever since I started learning computer science at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, I was always drawn to and was interested in taking this class. As a new student, most people I was acquantatined and befreinded were interested in game development and design or cybersecruity. My interests lied more in the fields of web development and design, and I was eagerly waiting for a chance to learn more about how to create high quality websites, and work on design aspects, and product management.


## Skills + Experience = Career



## Conclusion

During one of Professor Johnson's video, students were inspired to create projects and writings not for a grade, but to be shared with the world. As someone who has thought more about what I can contribute to the world rather than what I can do for myself, it made me think differently. First, and foremost, most of what I had worked on or created in the past was something I wanted to show or share with someone, or a group of people, or a community. I rarely ever worked on something just for myself, and now that I think about it, I guess I felt stronger on what others said and critiqued about my work rather than what I felt about it. This is where I think it's important to know where to draw a line on what you do for others and what you do for yourself. I believe I am not the only person who has done this, or thinks like this, as it is human nature for people to feel validated by other people rather than being able to validate yourself for your own achievements. This is something I have been working on since I started college. I want to feel proud of what I have done, and how I perceived something rather than relying on others for approval.
