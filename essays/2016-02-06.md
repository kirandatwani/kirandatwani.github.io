## Skills + Experience = Career

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Conclusion

During one of Professor Johnson's video, students were inspired to create projects and writings not for a grade, but to be shared with the world. As someone who has thought more about what I can contribute to the world rather than what I can do for myself, it made me think differently. First, and foremost, most of what I had worked on or created in the past was something I wanted to show or share with someone, or a group of people, or a community. I rarely ever worked on something just for myself, and now that I think about it, I guess I felt stronger on what others said and critiqued about my work rather than what I felt about it. This is where I think it's important to know where to draw a line on what you do for others and what you do for yourself. I believe I am not the only person who has done this, or thinks like this, as it is human nature for people to feel validated by other people rather than being able to validate yourself for your own achievements. This is something I have been working on since I started college. I want to feel proud of what I have done, and how I perceived something rather than relying on others for approval.
