## Start of my Coding Journey

<img class="ui medium right floated image" src="../images/stand.jpg">

When I first started programming in college, my code and lines were all over the place, and I didn't realize there was anything wrong until someone pointed it out, and helped me clean my code. I was surprised and intrigued because it was the first time someone had mentioned "coding standards", and before then, I was completely oblivious to it. If I were being honest, at that time, I didn't see the difference between my previous, messy code, and the new and improved, "cleaner" code. There were a few indents, and the close-curly-braces were adjusted to their proper lines, but to me, it looked pretty much the same. As someone who pays more attention to the small details rather than the big picture, I find it alarming how I wasn't able to nitpick on those tiny violations and errors when I first started.

Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.
