## A Whole New Field

I remember reading somewhere that it takes half a year in order to learn a new programming language. While I was surprised by this, it also made reasonable sense. I was surprised because generally in order to master any kind of skill to professional level would take as quoted by the popular author, Malcolm Gladwell, in his infamous book, the Outliers -- *** 10,000 hours *** ! If a person worked for 40 hours a week for 52 weeks, they would have approximately worked about 2,000 hours, which means it would take them 5 years to become a master! Of course, it depends, as with everything, some people would need more while others would require less. By this acquired information, a newbie could become a decent programmer able to conduct basic algorithms and solve problems after a semester of dedicating and devoting enough time into learning a new programming language. With that being said, it made sense how students jumped from Java (to possibly C in between) to Javascript.

## Thoughts on Javascript

So far, I think I am enjoying the programming language because of the way the class is structured. I think when compared to other languages, the experience I had learning Javascript, whether it be through freecodecamp, or trying to program a WOD, I felt Javascript was easier to understand and utilize than languages such as Java and C/C++. At the base of each language, I believe they have several parts in common, more or less, depending on the specific language, but I felt like I was learning new things in regard to specific formatting of the code and the overall appearance. I found that most unique to me, and it resembled less as complex programming, and more towards stylizing and developing structure. Since I have heard that Javascript is one of the most popular and used languages, it leads me to think that it is very valuable in the perspective of a software engineer. I can't say much on this, but I think that many software engineers use Javascript either wholly or partially in their programs.

## Running a Marathon

*"Speed does not mean sloppy, it means fluency"*
-Philip Johnson on 'Athletic Software Engineering' (*Link to article can be found* <a href="https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/athletic-software-engineering.html">*here*</a>.)

While reading about athletic software engineering, this quote caught my attention. I always felt intimidated by people who were able to program complex code in a few hours while I would get stuck on a single line for any amount of time. Time was always against me when I had tight deadlines and overlapping projects, and I believe many students agree. Whenever I was rushing to meet a time on a clock, I felt like I was running in a marathon, but with someone timing me. In a marathon, there are usually at least two types of runners: there are the sprinters and then there are the ones that go slow and steady. I believe the same can be said about programmers in a sense. When I am working on a WOD, I feel the same sense of rush, and personally for me, it's challenging because I take time completing projects well, but for others, the sheer adrenaline rush is their motivation for them to write well.

## A New Perspective

Everyone has a different style of learning, and I am quite hesitant that "athletic software engineering" might work for me because I don't do as well under pressure. That being said, I am open to change and learning how to learn in different ways, and I believe, like Professor Johnson mentioned a few lectures ago previously, this is preparation for the real world and potential interviews in the future. I think although they are stressful now, the WODs will prove to be useful and valuable, and keeping my hopes up, maybe even enjoyable.
