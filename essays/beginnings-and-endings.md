As yet another semester wraps up with finals, sleep deprivation, and a long-awaited summer break, I can say that my hopes in the field of computer science has risen.

Design Patterns are essentially the solutions developed from constant series of trials and errors to improve functionality and performance in software. If seen from the standpoint of someone who is not a computer programmer, it might seem like the concept of design patterns is not only applied to software engineering, but also in our lives. Whenever people make mistakes, it is commonly seen as either a bad aspect or it is defined as an invaluable learning opportunity. The concept of "learning from one's mistakes" can be correlated to design patterns.

## The End of the Beginning, the Beginning of the End

It might sound strange, but I am not too enthusiastic about beginnings and endings, be it in a movie, story, semester, or pretty much anything. For most people, beginnings are magical and exciting, and endings are wholesome and bittersweet. However for me, they just feel confusing and empty. As much as I love change, a part of me longs to stay in the calm middle of a story, or wishes it was still April, and not the end of another school year. It seems that time is traveling full-speed ahead, and I get closer and closer to the real world; and it's scary to think that in a little more than a year from now, I will be ending another chapter of my life, and starting a new one. That being said, it's not really another chapter, but more like a story in itself. So which part of my college career is the fundamentals of software engineering? Is it the end of the beginning because I am still very new in the field, and have just touched the tip of the iceberg? Or is it the beginning of the end, because I am getting closer to what I enjoy doing, and finding my path in computer science? I believe these are question that I may find an answer to in a couple of years as I take more computer science classes and see where my passions truly lie.
