As yet another semester wraps up with finals, sleep deprivation, and a long-awaited summer break, another level of a aspiring programmer's journey is achieved. Although a few months is a very short amount of time, during these last few months I have built a strong foundation and understanding of several software engineering principles. I was able to learn concepts such as open-source development, agile project managment, and ethics in software engineering, along with expanding on skills such as project planning, organizing team-oriented goals, and time management.

## Flow in Psychology

In psychology, there is a term for a "flow" state of being, which is also known informally as "being in the zone". In this state, a person is completely immersed in an activity with full focus, involvement, and enjoyment; it is when a person's challenge level and skill level meet at high percentages. In contrast, when a person experiences low percentages in both their challenge level and skill level, they are in a mental state of "apathy". When starting with different classes in computer science, I would always be in a "control" mental state, but soon I fell towards more of the "anxiety" and "worry" mentality. When catching a glimpse of software engineering, I realized I was at a "flow" state of being. The topics were challenging, but I felt with every week, I was steadily becoming more and more skilled, and enjoying it more, too.

Design Patterns are essentially the solutions developed from constant series of trials and errors to improve functionality and performance in software. If seen from the standpoint of someone who is not a computer programmer, it might seem like the concept of design patterns is not only applied to software engineering, but also in our lives. Whenever people make mistakes, it is commonly seen as either a bad aspect or it is defined as an invaluable learning opportunity. The concept of "learning from one's mistakes" can be correlated to design patterns.

## The End of the Beginning, the Beginning of the End

It might sound strange, but I am not too enthusiastic about beginnings and endings, be it in a movie, story, semester, or pretty much anything. For most people, beginnings are magical and exciting, and endings are wholesome and bittersweet. However for me, they just feel confusing and empty. As much as I love change, a part of me longs to stay in the calm middle of a story, or wishes it was still April, and not the end of another school year. It seems that time is traveling full-speed ahead, and I get closer and closer to the real world; and it's scary to think that in a little more than a year from now, I will be ending another chapter of my life, and starting a new one. That being said, it's not really another chapter, but more like a story in itself. So which part of my college career is the fundamentals of software engineering? Is it the end of the beginning because I am still very new in the field, and have just touched the tip of the iceberg? Or is it the beginning of the end, because I am getting closer to what I enjoy doing, and finding my path in computer science? I believe these are question that I may find an answer to in a couple of years as I take more computer science classes and see where my passions truly lie.
