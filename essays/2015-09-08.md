## A Whole New Field

I recall reading somewhere that it takes a half a year in order to learn a new programming language. While I was surprised by this, it also made reasonable sense. I was surprised because generally in order to master any kind of skill to professional level would take as quoted by the popular author, Malcolm Gladwell, in his infamous book, the Outliers -- *** 10,000 hours *** ! If a person worked for 40 hours a week for 52 weeks, they would have approximately worked about 2,000 hours, which means it would take them 5 years to become a master! Of course, it depends, as with everything, some people would need more while others would require less. By this acquired information, a newbie could become a decent programmer able to conduct basic algorithms and solve problems after a semester of dedicating and devoting enough time into learning a new programming language. With that being said, it made sense how students jumped from Java (to possibly C in between) to Javascript.

## Thoughts on Javascript

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

## Running a Marathon

*"Speed does not mean sloppy, it means fluency"* - Philip Johnson on 'Athletic Software Engineering'

While reading about athletic software engineering, this quote caught my attention. I always felt intimidated by people who were able to program complex code in a few hours while I would get stuck on a single line for any amount of time. Time was always against me when I had tight deadlines and overlapping projects, and I believe many students agree. Whenever I was rushing to meet a time on a clock, I felt like I was running in a marathon, but with someone timing me. In a marathon, there are usually at least two types of runners: there are the sprinters and then there are the ones that go slow and steady. I believe the same can be said about programmers in a sense. When I am working on a WOD, I feel the same sense of rush, and personally for me, it's challenging because I take time completing projects well, but for others, the sheer adrenline rush is their motivation for them to write well. 

## A New Perspective

Everyone has a different style of learning, and I am quite hesitant that "athletci soaftware engineering" might work for me because I don't do as well under pressure. That being said, I am open to change and learning how to learn in different ways, and I beleive, like the Professor mentioned a few lectures ago previously, this is preparation for the real world and potential interviews in the future. I think although they are stressful now, the WODs will prove to be useful and valuable, and keeping my hopes up, maybe even enjoyable.
