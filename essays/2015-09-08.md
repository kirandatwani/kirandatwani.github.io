## Is there such thing as a stupid question?

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If you’re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?



## What’s a smart question?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## Conclusion

During one of Professor Johnson's video, students were inspired to create projects and writings not for a grade, but to be shared with the world. As someone who has thought more about what I can contribute to the world rather than what I can do for myself, it made me think differently. First, and foremost, most of what I had worked on or created in the past was something I wanted to show or share with someone, or a group of people, or a community. I rarely ever worked on something just for myself, and now that I think about it, I guess I felt stronger on what others said and critiqued about my work rather than what I felt about it. This is where I think it's important to know where to draw a line on what you do for others and what you do for yourself. I believe I am not the only person who has done this, or thinks like this, as it is human nature for people to feel validated by other people rather than being able to validate yourself for your own achievements. This is something I have been working on since I started college. I want to feel proud of what I have done, and how I perceived something rather than relying on others for approval.

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
