## A Whole New Field

I recall reading somewhere that it takes a half a year in order to learn a new programming language. While I was surprised by this, it also made reasonable sense. I was surprised because generally in order to master any kind of skill to professional level would take as quoted by the popular author, Malcolm Gladwell, in his infamous book, the Outliers -- *** 10,000 hours *** ! If a person worked for 40 hours a week for 52 weeks, they would have approximately worked about 2,000 hours, which means it would take them 5 years to become a master! Of course, it depends, as with everything, some people would need more while others would require less. By this acquired information, a newbie could become a decent programmer able to conduct basic algorithms and solve problems after a semester of dedicating and devoting enough time into learning a new programming language. With that being said, it made sense how students jumped from Java (to possibly C in between) to Javascript.

## Thoughts on Javascript

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

*Speed does not mean sloppy, it means fluency*


What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## Conclusion

<img class="ui medium right floated image" src="../images/code2.jpg">

During one of Professor Johnson's video, students were inspired to create projects and writings not for a grade, but to be shared with the world. As someone who has thought more about what I can contribute to the world rather than what I can do for myself, it made me think differently. First, and foremost, most of what I had worked on or created in the past was something I wanted to show or share with someone, or a group of people, or a community. I rarely ever worked on something just for myself, and now that I think about it, I guess I felt stronger on what others said and critiqued about my work rather than what I felt about it. This is where I think it's important to know where to draw a line on what you do for others and what you do for yourself. I believe I am not the only person who has done this, or thinks like this, as it is human nature for people to feel validated by other people rather than being able to validate yourself for your own achievements. This is something I have been working on since I started college. I want to feel proud of what I have done, and how I perceived something rather than relying on others for approval.
