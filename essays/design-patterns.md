It came to me as a surprise that design patterns were actually solutions that were developed from frequent problems that were at some point presented to software engineers. The whole concept was more confusing than I had thought, and didn't have a whole lot to do with the visual aspect or the aesthetics of an application or website. Even now as I am still trying to grasp my head around it, I realized how similar the concept seemed to people's daily lives, the numerous problems that we encounter, and solutions we develop and implement.

## Learning from Mistakes

Design Patterns are essentially the solutions developed from constant series of trials and errors to improve functionality and performance in software. If seen from the standpoint of someone who is not a computer programmer, it might seem like the concept of design patterns is not only applied to software engineering, but also in our lives. Whenever people make mistakes, it is commonly seen as either a bad aspect or it is defined as an invaluable learning opportunity. The concept of "learning from one's mistakes" can be correlated to design patterns. Such an example can be how
