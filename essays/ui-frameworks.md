UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

Feel free to go in another direction entirely, as long as you are discussing UI Frameworks, and as long as the result is interesting, informative, and insightful. Write for the world!


## Semantics as the unknown "magic"

## Running a Marathon


-Philip Johnson on 'Athletic Software Engineering' (*Link to article can be found* <a href="https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/athletic-software-engineering.html">*here*</a>.)

While reading about athletic software engineering, this quote caught my attention. I always felt intimidated by people who were able to program complex code in a few hours while I would get stuck on a single line for any amount of time. Time was always against me when I had tight deadlines and overlapping projects, and I believe many students agree. Whenever I was rushing to meet a time on a clock, I felt like I was running in a marathon, but with someone timing me. In a marathon, there are usually at least two types of runners: there are the sprinters and then there are the ones that go slow and steady. I believe the same can be said about programmers in a sense. When I am working on a WOD, I feel the same sense of rush, and personally for me, it's challenging because I take time completing projects well, but for others, the sheer adrenaline rush is their motivation for them to write well.
