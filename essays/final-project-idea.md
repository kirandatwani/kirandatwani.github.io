Mockup page ideas
- Landing Page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page
- User solution submit page
- Admin problems submit page

- Leaderboard (users with most correct solutions)

Use case ideas
- User goes to landing page, uses log-in page, and uses the user profile page and user home page
- Admin goes to landing page, uses log-in page, and uses the admin home page
- Admin is able to see all problem solutions and submit problems
- User is able to see problems and submit solutions
- All have access to past problems and solutions

Beyond the basics
- Textbox/format property (depending on programming langauge)
- Compling algorithm/code
