Personally, ever since I started learning computer science at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, I was always drawn to and was interested in taking this class. As a new student, most people I was acquantatined and befriended were interested in game development and design or cybersecurity. My interests lied more in the fields of web development and design, and I was eagerly waiting for a chance to learn more about how to create high quality websites, and work on design aspects, and product management. Much like any other field, software engineering encompasses several fields, such as web development, app development and so forth. My interests in software engineering include web development and/or design, and potentially app development, since there might be overall similarities between the two.

## Skills + Experience = Career

One of the major skills I wish to develop is quicker, more efficient problem-solving skills. This applies to fields outside of computer science too, but solving each problem or portion of code requires a strong skill set of being able to see a problem, and take the necessary steps or actions to solve it. Another skill that I have been working on in the past years is effective team collaboration. I initially would joke and believe that computer scientists would not be working with other people, and only be staring at their screens for huge amounts of time. I learned quickly that that is far from the truth, and it is not only important, but essential for aspiring students wanting to pursue a career in software engineering, and so forth. I believe that with experience from this class, I shall be able to develop myself in both aspects that will ultimately help me for my future career.

## Conclusion

During one of Professor Johnson's videos, students were inspired to create projects and writings not for a grade, but to be shared with the world. As someone who has thought more about what I can contribute to the world rather than what I can do for myself, it made me think differently. First, and foremost, most of what I had worked on or created in the past was something I wanted to show or share with someone, or a group of people, or a community. I rarely ever worked on something just for myself, and now that I think about it, I guess I felt stronger on what others said and critiqued about my work rather than what I felt about it. This is where I think it's important to know where to draw a line on what you do for others and what you do for yourself. I believe I am not the only person who has done this, or thinks like this, as it is human nature for people to feel validated by other people rather than being able to validate yourself for your own achievements. This is something I have been working on since I started college. I want to feel proud of what I have done, and how I perceived something rather than relying on others for approval.
